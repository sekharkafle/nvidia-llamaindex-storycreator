Here is the prompt for page 17:

"Generate an image of a joyful celebration scene in the forest, featuring the little sparrow, a friendly rabbit, a brave firefighter, a kind teacher, a wise owl, a clever little ant, the king, and the carpenter (a skilled builder) all cheering and high-fiving each other, surrounded by confetti and balloons, with the little sparrow proudly holding its recovered bean in the center of the image."

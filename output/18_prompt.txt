Here is the prompt for page 18:

"Illustrate the little sparrow, with its shiny brown feathers and bright curious eyes, standing in the center of the forest, surrounded by its new friends, including the clever little ant, the kind teacher, the brave firefighter, the wise owl, and the skilled carpenter, all of whom are smiling and celebrating together, with confetti and balloons in the background, to represent the joy and gratitude of the sparrow for the help it received in solving its big problem."

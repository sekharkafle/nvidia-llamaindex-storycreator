Here is the prompt for page 10:

"An illustration of a small, clever ant with a big smile on its face, standing on a tiny rock, looking up at the worried little sparrow, who is perched on a nearby branch, with a nest in the background, surrounded by lush green leaves, as the ant says, 'Don't worry, I'll help you find that bean!' with a determined look on its face."

Here is the prompt for page 6:

"Draw a picture of the little sparrow, a small brown bird with a worried expression, standing in front of a group of busy animals, including a friendly rabbit, a brave firefighter, a kind teacher, and a wise owl, all of whom are too busy to help the sparrow, with the rabbit munching on a carrot, the firefighter holding a hose, the teacher grading papers, and the owl reading a book, in a beautiful forest with tall trees and colorful flowers."
